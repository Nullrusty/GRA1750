      <h2>Dante Changes</h2>
      <p>More changes to Dante added to adress feedback about balance changes made in Hotfix 35.5.3</p>
      <p>Dark Verse: Made Dark Verse’s Line of Sight (LoS) checks more reliable to bring it in line with Tragedy. Following the improvements to Tragedy’s LoS last week, we’ve applied the same logic to Dark Verse to ensure enemies within LoS are properly considered to prevent cases where being only partially visible would not trigger the check. This is part of the greater LoS improvements detailed in the “Line of Sight Improvements” section below.</p>
      <p>Pageflight: Returned the Status Damage increase applied to enemies hit by its Paragrimms. At Max Rank, the Status Damage Increase is 50% (scaleable with Ability Strength). This was an undocumented/unintended element of Pageflight at release that we decided to remove, but in doing so, we broke our promise of “not touching damage” with Dante, so we’ve returned it, and it now has proper documentation in the ability UI!</p>
      <p>Tragedy: Because of the return of Pageflight’s Status Damage increase, we have added a 1 billion damage cap to Tragedy, purely as a preventative measure against game errors. This is our highest damage cap in the game, a testament to how powerful Pageflight and Tragedy can be with the right setup. We will monitor feedback and performance over a longer time span before reviewing again.</p>
